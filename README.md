A soccer tournament system with points that generates random results for each match and defines a winner

## Motivation

This project was made for a challenge made by a selective employment process.

### The challenge

Develop a running point soccers tournament system where everyone
clubs face each other in two shifts. This system should have the following features:

1. Read a TextArea containing a list of teams and their respective region separated by “;”
2. Display the match combination for all teams on the screen, indicating the city of the game, round trip, etc;
3. Display the combination of return games on the screen, inverting the order of each game of the first round;
4. Generate a random result for each game generated in the turn and return;
5. Determine the champion, considering: Victory = 3 points; Draw = 1 point;
6. Flag matches with the text "Double Round" when there are two games in the same city in the same round;
